# Workflow Test File

This file is used to test the TODO-to-issue GitHub workflow integration.

<!-- TODO: Test GitHub Project integration workflow
This is a test TODO to verify that:
1. Issues are created from TODO comments
2. Issues are automatically added to project #11
3. Issue status is set to "Backlog"
4. All labels and metadata are properly assigned

If this issue appears in the project board with "Backlog" status, the workflow is working correctly!

assignees: codingbutter
labels: test, enhancement
milestone: MVP Launch

After the workflow runs successfully, this file can be deleted.
